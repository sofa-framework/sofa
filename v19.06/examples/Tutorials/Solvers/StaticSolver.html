                The StaticSolver contains the algorithm used to update particle positions at each time step. As we are dealing with a Static solver, <b>time (i.e. velocity and acceleration terms) is not taken into account</b>. At each time step, the solver is looking for an equilibrium of the generalized forces at each nodes. Using a static solver can be useful to measure the convergence of several algorithms.<br><br>
                Solving for each point, the static equation amounts to solving a linear system Ax=b. In this scene, the static solver is coupled with an iterative linear solver: the CGLinearSolver, used to solve equation systems. <br>
