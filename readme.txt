SOFA is an Open Source framework primarily targeted at real-time simulation, 
with an emphasis on medical simulation. It is mainly intended for the 
research community to help foster newer algorithms, but can also be used as 
an efficient prototyping tool. SOFA's advanced software architecture allows:
(1) the creation of complex and evolving simulations by combining new algorithms
    with existing algorithms; 
(2) the modification of key parameters of the simulation  such as deformable
    behavior, surface representation, solvers, constraints, collision algorithm,
    etc. by simply editing an XML file; 
(3) the synthesis of complex models from simpler ones using a scene-graph
    description; 
(4) the efficient simulation of the dynamics of interacting objects using
    abstract equation solvers; and 
(5) the comparison of various algorithms available in SOFA.
