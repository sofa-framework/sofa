/** Semi-implicit time integrator using backward Euler scheme for first and second degree ODEs. (default: second)
 *
 *** 2nd Order ***
 *
 * This is based on [Baraff and Witkin, Large Steps in Cloth Simulation, SIGGRAPH 1998]
 * The integration scheme is based on the following equations:
 *
 *   \f$x_{t+h} = x_t + h v_{t+h}\f$
 *   \f$v_{t+h} = v_t + h a_{t+h}\f$
 *
 *   The unknown is
 *   \f$v_{t+h} - v_t = dv\f$
 *
 *   Newton's law is
 *   \f$ M dv = h f(t+h) \f$
 *   \f$ M dv = h ( f(t) + K dx     + (B - r_M M + r_K K) (v+dv) )\f$
 *   \f$ M dv = h ( f(t) + K h (v+dv) + (B - r_M M + r_K K) (v+dv) )\f$
 *
 *   \f$ M \f$ is the mass matrix.
 *   \f$ K = df/dx \f$ is the stiffness implemented (or not) by the force fields.
 *   \f$ B = df/dv \f$ is the damping implemented (or not) by the force fields.
 *   An additional, uniform Rayleigh damping  \f$- r_M M + r_K K\f$ is imposed by the solver.
 *
 * This corresponds to the following equation system:
 *
 *   \f$ ( (1+h r_M) M - h B - h(h + r_K) K ) dv = h ( f(t) + (h+r_K) K v + B v - r_M M v )\f$
 *
 * Moreover, the projective constraints filter out the forbidden motions.
 * This is equivalent with multiplying vectors with a projection matrix \f$P\f$.
 * Finally, the equation system set by this ode solver is:
 *
 *   \f$ P ( (1+h r_M) M - h B - h(h + r_K) K ) P dv = P h ( f(t) + (h + r_K) K v + B v - r_M M v )\f$
 *
 *** 1st Order ***
 *
 * This integration scheme is based on the following equation:
 *
 *   \f$x_{t+h} = x_t + h v_{t+h}\f$
 *
 * Applied to this mechanical system:
 *
 *   \f$ M v_t = f_{ext} \f$
 *
 *   \f$ M v_{t+h} = f_{ext_{t+h}} \f$
 *   \f$           = f_{ext_{t}} + h (df_{ext}/dt)_{t+h} \f$
 *   \f$           = f_{ext_{t}} + h (df_{ext}/dx)_{t+h} v_{t+h} \f$
 *   \f$           = f_{ext_{t}} - h K v_{t+h} \f$
 *
 *   \f$ ( M + h K ) v_{t+h} = f_{ext} \f$
 *
 *
 *** Trapezoidal Rule ***
 *
 * The trapezoidal scheme is based on
 *
 *   \f$v_{t+h} = h/2 ( f(t+h) + f(t) )\f$
 *
 * With this and the same techniques as for the implicit Euler scheme we receive for *** 2nd Order *** equations
 *
 *   \f$ P ( (1+h/2 r_M) M - h/2 B - h/2 (h + r_K) K ) P dv = P h/2 ( 2 f(t) + (h + r_K) K v + B v - r_M M v )\f$
 *
 * and for *** 1st Order ***
 *
 *   \f$ ( M + h/2 K ) v_{t+h} = f_{ext} \f$
