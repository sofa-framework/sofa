 * @brief Perform an extensive pair-wise collision test based on the bounding volume of collision models

 * This component is a broad phase algorithm used during collision detection to limit the number of pairs of objects
 * that need to be checked for intersection. The algorithm output is a list of pairs of objects that can potentially
 * be in intersection. This list is then used as an input for a narrow phase algorithm.
 * In this algorithm, all possible pairs of objects are tested (brute force test). If there are n objects, there will be
 * n^2/2 tests. The tests are based on the bounding volume of the objects, usually an axis-aligned bounding box.
