		<div id="orangeText">Description</div><br>
        Alike EulerSolver in Sofa, RungeKuttaSolver denotes the ODE solver using the explicit integration scheme for computing of 
		the dynamic system. This integration scheme explicitely resolves the system in relation to time : given the mechanical state
		at time T<sub>n</sub>, compute the state at time T<sub>n+1</sub>=T<sub>n</sub> + dt. The difference in RungeKuttaSolver is this 
		integration use a more sophisticated algorithm for the computation of the state at time T<sub>n+1</sub>. Therefore there are more stability
		and can use the time step higher than the EulerSolver one. Otherwise, RungeKuttaSolver use a more general explicit method than EulerSolver.
        <br><br>

		<div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
		As every Explicit Integration method, RungeKutta accumulates errors for each time step. Therefore two criteria must be 
		controled when using it : 
		<ul>
                  <li>The time step dt.</li>
                  <li>The dynamic of the system.</li>
                </ul>
		<p>
		However, RungeKutta4 is certainly more stable than ExpliciteEuler : The convergence error in RungeKutta4 is in relation to o(dt<sup>4</sup>), 
		but in ExpliciteEuler it's only o(dt). For this example, RungeKutta can resolve the system with dt=0.001, but not the ExplicitEuler (0.0001). 
        <br><br>
		Users can try several solvers with different parameters dt to have the idea of the solver's difference (also test the dependence of the solver 
		according to the dynamic of the system by using [Shift + leftmouse]).
