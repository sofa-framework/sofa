		<br><div id="orangeText">Description</div>
		
        <p>The objective of this small step by step tutorial is to discover the basic components used with SOFA, how they interact, and how you can configure them. We will create a pendulum made of two object, and two different springs. We will not go into the details about the template parameter of the mechanical states, nor the forcefields used.</p>
                
        <div id="tutorialAction"><p>Press the <b>Edit in Modeler</b> button at the top of the window.</p></div>

         <p>This will show the <b>scene graph</b> for our initial basic scene in the Modeler window.</p>
                
		<div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
                We used 3 components:
                <ul>
                  <li> A <b>Node</b> "FirstObject" to store the components describing the object we want to simulate. It is important that the hierarchy of the nodes in the scene graph reflects the scene you want to model.</li>
                  <li> The shape is modeled using a <b>MechanicalObject</b> which describes the particle states. </li>
                  <li> A <b>UniformMass</b> is added for the MechanicalObject, giving  the same mass for each particle of the MechanicalObject. </li>
                </ul>

        <div id="tutorialAction"><p>Hold the cursor over the button with the SOFA logo on the far right of the Modeler toolbar.</p> </div>
        
        <p>The tooltip will say <b>Run in SOFA</b>.</p>
           
        <p><div id="tutorialAction">Press this <b>Run in SOFA</b> button.</div></p>
        
        <p>This will open the scene described by the scene graph in SOFA. In SOFA, you can see one Particle represented by a white dot. (Note: you may need to select "Behavior" in the View table in order to see the scene).</p>

		<div id="orangeText">Results</div>
		
         <p><div id="tutorialAction">Press the <b>Animate</b> button.</div></p>
         
         <p>You will see that nothing happens. In the next step we will see why.</p>
