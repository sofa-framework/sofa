		Now that we manage to submit a particle to the Gravity, let's try to fix a particle in space using a constraint. Several Sofa components implement the concept of constraints. Take you time to try the different constraints: in the modeler, simply click on one of them, and then open the example provided.
		<br><div id="orangeText">Key points</div><br>
                To fix a particle to its position, we use a filter based constraint called <b>FixConstraint</b>: it sets to zero the velocities and acceleration of a set of particles. If you edit the component, you will see that you can specify several indices corresponding to the particles to be constrained.

                The particle doesn't fall anymore: as debug information, we use pink squares to indicate the fixed particles. <br>
Contrary to the first scene of this tutorial, a simulation is launched, forces accumulated, and an ODE computes the new positions and velocities! To be sure of that, we will add one particle to the MechanicalObject: the particle of index "0" will still be constrained to its original position.
